# E-commerce Store

This e-commerce platform is a straightforward implementation created using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Stripe, and MySQL, utilizing PlanetScale for demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The application allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and checkout using Stripe for payments.

## Test

When testing interactively, use a card number, such as 4242 4242 4242.
Use a valid date in the future, such as 12/34.
Use any three-digit check digit/CVC (four digits for American Express cards).
Use any value for other form fields.
